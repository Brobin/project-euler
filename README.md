# Project Euler Solutions

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of challenginng mathematical and computational problems.
This repository contains my solutions to several fo the problems, mostly in Python. I am using this project as an opportunity to improve and hone my skills in programming, computational thinking, and the programming language, Python.
